# Soccer Tournaments

A tournament system developed with ASP.NET Web Forms, MVP, Ninject(Containers), with added unit testing.

A user that is not logged in can view details about tournaments, games, sponsors, players, teams, players in teams.

A logged-in user is able to make changes, insert into the server's database and be exposed to greater part of the web site.

Although this application is limited in terms of functionality, it demonstrates a use of the MVP pattern, wherein the solution
is divided into model, view, and presenter parts, so that business logic is separated (and hidden) from presenters and the app
is easily extendable and testable.
